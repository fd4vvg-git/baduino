Usb Rubber Duckys are too damn expensive

This only works for HID compatible arduinos.

A state of the art security (4 pin button) controls when the payload is executed for easy re-programming.

Button is wired to Digital Pin 3 and ground.

Use Ducky2Duino.py (made by me), to make payloads from duckyscript. It works on most ducky scripts made for the usb rubber ducky. Some complex duckyscript 3.0 syntax doesn't work with it.

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DUMB SH*T YOU DO WITH THIS
