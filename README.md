Usb Rubber Duckys are too damn expensive

This only works for HID compatible arduinos.

A state of the art security (4 pin button) controls when the payload is executed for easy re-programming.

Button is wired to Digital Pin 3 and ground.

Use Ducky2Duino.py (made by me), to make payloads from duckyscript. It works on most ducky scripts made for the usb rubber ducky. Some complex duckyscript 3.0 syntax doesn't work with it.
Example: 'python3 Ducky2Duino.py -h' for help menu.

--> Leave a comment for any suggestions.

For all educational purposes of course (dont hack anyone).
