Usb Rubber Duckys are too damn expensive

This only works for HID compatible arduinos.

A state of the art security (button) controls when the payload is executed for easy re-programming,

Button is wired to Digital Pin 2 and ground.

This is purely a template, payloads will be added in the near future.

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DUMB SHIT YOU DO WITH THIS

Thanks,
